## üß™ Week 3 Challenge ‚Äî 7-Segment Display with Servomotors

The **third-week challenge** was centered around building a **7-segment display** using **7 individual servomotors**, each representing one segment of the display. The goal was to precisely control the servomotors using PWM signals to represent digits from **0 to 9**.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Block 1 ‚Äì Arduino-Compatible Subsystem

At the heart of the system is the **ATmega328P** microcontroller, which executes the control logic. It is powered by a regulated **5‚ÄØV supply**, produced by the following power stage:

* **LM7809** linear regulator receives **14.8‚ÄØV** from the external power source and outputs **9‚ÄØV**
* A **Zener diode** regulates the 9‚ÄØV to a stable **5‚ÄØV** for logic circuitry

This stage delivers **two voltage outputs**:

* üî¥ **9‚ÄØV** (monitored by a red LED)
* üü¢ **5‚ÄØV** (monitored by a green LED)

The **ATmega328P** is clocked with a **16‚ÄØMHz quartz oscillator**, and stabilized using **two 22‚ÄØ¬µF electrolytic capacitors**. A **push-button** is integrated for manually resetting the microcontroller.

All I/O pins are routed to header pins, making the circuit **fully compatible with Arduino shields and accessories**.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Block 2 ‚Äì PCA9685 and Servo Control

The **PCA9685** module handles PWM signal generation for the **7 servomotors**. Connections are as follows:

| PCA9685 Pin | Connected To                   |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| **GND**     | Shared system ground           |
| **VCC**     | 5‚ÄØV logic supply               |
| **V++**     | 9‚ÄØV motor supply from LM7809   |
| **SDA**     | Connected to ATmega328P **A4** |
| **SCL**     | Connected to ATmega328P **A5** |

Each **servomotor** is connected to the module through its corresponding PWM channel, with:

* Signal ‚Üí PCA9685 output
* Power ‚Üí **V++ (9‚ÄØV)**
* Ground ‚Üí shared GND

### ‚ö° Estimated Power Consumption

| Component                             | Quantity | Approx. Current (per unit)   | Total Current |
| ------------------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------- | ------------- |
| ATmega328P                            | 1        | 15‚ÄØmA @ 5‚ÄØV                  | \~15‚ÄØmA       |
| PCA9685 module                        | 1        | 10‚ÄØmA @ 5‚ÄØV                  | \~10‚ÄØmA       |
| Servomotors (SG90 type)               | 7        | \~200‚ÄØmA (avg) / 500‚ÄØmA peak | \~1.4‚ÄØA total |
| LEDs (Red & Green)                    | 2        | \~10‚ÄØmA each                 | 20‚ÄØmA         |
| Miscellaneous (resistors, Zener loss) | ‚Äî        | \~5‚Äì10‚ÄØmA                    | \~10‚ÄØmA       |

**Estimated total current draw**:

* On **5‚ÄØV line (logic)**: \~50‚Äì70‚ÄØmA
* On **9‚ÄØV line (servos)**: up to **1.5‚ÄØA** (when multiple servos move simultaneously)

**Estimated power usage**:

* **5‚ÄØV rail** ‚Üí 5‚ÄØV √ó 0.07‚ÄØA = **0.35‚ÄØW**
* **9‚ÄØV rail** ‚Üí 9‚ÄØV √ó 1.5‚ÄØA = **13.5‚ÄØW**
* **Total estimated power**: **\~14‚ÄØW**

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The power stage must be **well-cooled** (especially the LM7809), and servos should ideally be powered from an **external 9‚ÄØV regulated supply**, especially under load.
