# Troubleshooting Guide for Conveyor-Site

This document provides solutions to common issues that may arise during the development or deployment of the Conveyor-Site project. It also includes tips for debugging and resolving errors.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Environment Variables Not Loaded
**Issue:** The application fails to connect to the Redis database, and errors related to environment variables are displayed.

**Solution:** Ensure that the `.env.local` file is present in the root directory of the project and contains the correct environment variables. For example:

```
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=https://equal-marlin-47836.upstash.io
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

### 2. API Endpoint Errors
**Issue:** API requests return 404 or 500 errors.

**Solution:** 
- Check the API routes defined in the `app/api` directory to ensure they are correctly implemented.
- Verify that the server is running and that the API endpoints are accessible.
- Use tools like Postman or curl to test the endpoints directly.

### 3. Frontend Not Updating
**Issue:** Changes made to the frontend components do not reflect in the browser.

**Solution:** 
- Ensure that the development server is running. Restart the server if necessary.
- Clear the browser cache or try accessing the application in incognito mode.
- Check for any console errors in the browser's developer tools that may indicate issues with the React components.

### 4. Dependency Issues
**Issue:** Errors related to missing or incompatible packages during installation.

**Solution:** 
- Run `pnpm install` or `yarn install` to ensure all dependencies are correctly installed.
- Check the `package.json` file for any version conflicts and resolve them by updating or downgrading packages as needed.

### 5. Deployment Failures
**Issue:** The application fails to deploy to the production environment.

**Solution:** 
- Review the deployment logs for any error messages that can provide insight into the failure.
- Ensure that all environment variables are set correctly in the production environment.
- Check the configuration settings in the deployment platform to ensure they match the requirements of the Conveyor-Site project.

## Debugging Tips

- Use console logs strategically throughout your code to trace the flow of execution and identify where issues may be occurring.
- Utilize browser developer tools to inspect network requests, console errors, and performance metrics.
- If using a version control system, check the commit history to identify recent changes that may have introduced bugs.

By following this troubleshooting guide, you should be able to resolve common issues encountered while working with the Conveyor-Site project. If problems persist, consider reaching out to the development community or consulting additional resources for further assistance.
