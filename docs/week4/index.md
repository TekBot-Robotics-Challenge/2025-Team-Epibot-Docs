# FINAL TEST - THE CONVEYOR: Documentation

## Summary

- [1. General Context](#1-general-context)
- [2. Test Objective](#2-test-objective)

## 1. General Context

This is the final selection test of the **Tekbot Robotics Challenge 2025**. It is a **multidisciplinary challenge** involving the different divisions: **mechanical**, **electronic**, and **computer science**.

## 2. Test Objective

Design an **intelligent conveyor system** capable of automatically sorting four types of waste, represented by **colored cubes** (green, yellow, red, blue).  
The system must detect waste, activate the conveyor belt, and display the sorting results **in real time** on a dedicated **web interface**.

### How we designed our conveyor:

- The conveyor remains **stationary** until waste is detected.  
- The waste is then **identified by color** using a **color sensor**.  
- The detected color is then **sent to the web platform**.  
- A **web interface** allows **real-time monitoring** of the quantity of sorted waste.
