This circuit is a faithful and functional reproduction of an **Arduino Uno** board, built around the **ATmega328P-P** microcontroller, with complete power management, programming, and expansion interfaces. This design aims to provide a standalone board that is fully compatible with various embedded modules.

### 1. Microcontroller and Clock

The heart of the system is an **ATmega328P**, clocked at **16 MHz** using a **quartz** connected to pins XTAL1 and XTAL2. Two **22 pF ceramic capacitors** ensure oscillation stability, in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. This configuration guarantees timekeeping accuracy and the reliability of the microcontroller in all its operations.

### 2. Reset Circuit

A **push button** is integrated and connected to the **RESET** pin of the microcontroller, with a **10 kΩ pull-up resistor** to prevent accidental reboots. When the button is pressed, the RESET pin is temporarily connected to ground, causing a clean system reset.

### 3. Power Management

The board receives a **14.7V** input voltage via a **2-pin terminal block**. A **1N4007 rectifier diode** is placed at the input to protect the circuit against accidental polarity reversals.

An **LM7809 linear regulator** stabilizes this voltage at **9V**, and its output is accessible via a second terminal block to power any external modules requiring this voltage.

To provide a 5V power supply to the microcontroller and its peripherals, the circuit uses a 5.1V 1N4733A Zener diode, mounted to regulate the output voltage. This ingenious choice eliminates the need for a 7805 regulator while ensuring sufficient voltage for the 5V components. Three 220 µF electrolytic capacitors are arranged for filtering: upstream and downstream of the LM7809, as well as in parallel with the Zener, to stabilize voltages and filter out interference.

Two status LEDs display the active voltages:

* A red LED (3V) in series with a 330 Ω resistor indicates the presence of 9V.
* A green LED (3V) in series with a 220 Ω resistor indicates the availability of 5V.

### 4. USB Interface – Programming

The board integrates the **CH340G** circuit, a **USB-to-serial** converter, essential for programming the ATmega328P from a PC. This module provides communication between the USB port and the microcontroller's **RX/TX** pins (PD0/PD1), allowing code upload from the Arduino IDE.

A **6-pin female header** is also included to facilitate programming via an external USB-TTL cable, or for serial communication with other modules.

### 5. Expansion Connectors

Two **14-pin female headers** expose all the ATmega328P's digital and analog pins:

* Pins **D0 to D13** (digital inputs/outputs),
* Pins **A0 to A5** (analog inputs).

An additional 6-pin female header provides convenient access to communication lines or SPI/ICSP programming.

6. Available Voltage Outputs

The board offers two power outputs via terminal blocks:

* A 9V output, taken directly from the LM7809, to power more powerful loads or modules,
* A 5V output, stabilized via a 5.1V Zener diode, to power logic modules, sensors, and peripherals requiring 5V.

### 7. Compatibility and Integration

This board is designed to be **100% compatible with separately developed embedded modules**, including:

* The **KY-008 laser module**,
* The **photoresistor module with potentiometer adjustment**,
* The **TCS34725 color sensor module**,
* The **A4988 stepper motor driver**.

Each of these modules is powered by the 5V or 9V lines provided by the board, as needed, via the output terminals.
