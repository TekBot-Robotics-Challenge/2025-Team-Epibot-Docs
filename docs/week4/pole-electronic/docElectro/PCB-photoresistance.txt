##  2. **Photoresistor Module PCB**

This PCB is responsible for **detecting an object** passing in front of the laser by **measuring the change in light**. It is used in `Photoresistor::isHit()` to enable or disable sorting.

###  Components:

* **Photoresistor (LDR)**: Detects ambient light.
* **10 kÎ© Potentiometer (RV1)**: Dynamically adjusts the **detection threshold** based on lighting conditions.
* **10 kÎ© Resistor (R5)**: Forms a **divider bridge** with the LDR to provide a variable analog voltage.
* **3V Green LED + 220 ohm Resistor (R6)**: Indicator indicating detection or simply power on.

* **2 2-pin terminal blocks**:

* One for the **power supply** (VCC/GND).
* Another for the **analog output** (signal from the LDR or potentiometer).

### ðŸ”§ Function:

* The system reads the voltage on the LDR (`photoPin = A0`) and compares it to the voltage from the potentiometer (`thresholdPin = A1`).
* If the voltage exceeds, the `isHit()` method returns `true`, triggering the motor to stop.
* This PCB is **highly configurable** via the potentiometer, making it **robust** in a variety of lighting environments.
