## 5-Week Structure

| Week      | Objectives                      | Focus                  |
|-----------|--------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Week 1** | Prototyping & Setup            | Round 1 Tests (per pole) |
| **Week 2** | Integration & Optimization     | Round 2 Tests (per pole) |
| **Week 3** | Finalization & Deployment      | Round 3 Tests (per pole) |
| **Week 4 & Week 5** | Final Test Preparation         | Test Finalization       |


## Rigorous Pre-Selection Phase

Before the final stage of the challenge, a **technical pre-selection phase** was conducted to evaluate core skills.
