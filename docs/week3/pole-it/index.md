## The Goal of this Week
During this week we must implement an autonomous navigation system for a mobile robot using **ROS 2 Humble**, **Gazebo simulator**, **Rviz2** and **Slam toolbox**. Create a pathfinding algorithm that enables a robot to navigate between points while avoiding obstacles in a simulated maze environment.

### The Main Tasks
- Implement a pathfinding algorithm one of this (A*, Dijkstra, RRT, or similar) we choose A*
- Develop obstacle avoidance capabilities
- Test solution in Gazebo simulation
- Visualize results in RViz 2

### What we must do 

1. **Implement a Functional pathfinding algorithm**
   - Efficient path computation
   - Correct implementation

2. **Obstacle handling**
   - Reliable collision avoidance
   - Real-time response

3. **Simulation & visualization**
   - Clear Gazebo simulation
   - Effective RViz 2 visualization

4. **Configuration**
   - Proper ROS 2/Gazebo setup

5. **Documentation**
   - Algorithm explanation
   - Technical choices justification
   - Results analysis
