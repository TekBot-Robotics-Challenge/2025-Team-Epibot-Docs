# Creating a Map with SLAM Toolbox (Step-by-Step Guide)

Hey there! I'm going to walk you through the full process of how **we created a map using `SLAM Toolbox` in ROS 2**. I'll try to explain everything like I'm talking to my grandma slowly, clearly, and with real-world examples.

---

## What is SLAM?

SLAM stands for **`Simultaneous Localization And Mapping`**. Imagine you're in a dark room with a flashlight and you try to draw a map as you explore it. You don't know where you are at first, and the room is unfamiliar. But little by little, you build the map while figuring out your position at the same time.

That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre doing with our robot: making a map and figuring out its location in real-time.

---

## What We Needed (Requirements)

Before we started, we made sure to have:

* **ROS 2 Humble** installed on our computer üê¢
* **SLAM Toolbox** package
* A robot model that publishes **LaserScan** (`/scan`) and **TF** (transform tree)
* **RViz** for visualization

---

## `Step 1`: Creating the ROS 2 Workspace

We created a workspace where we would build and organize all the packages:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/2025-Team-Epibot-Code/week3/IT_pole/tekbot_ws/src
cd ~/2025-Team-Epibot-Code/week3/IT_pole/tekbot_ws
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
```

---

## `Step 2`: Installing SLAM Toolbox

We installed the SLAM Toolbox package like this:

```bash
sudo apt install ros-humble-slam-toolbox
```

---

## `Step 3`: Launching SLAM Toolbox for Mapping

We created a custom launch file that starts both the **SLAM node**. Here‚Äôs an example:

```python
from launch import LaunchDescription
from launch_ros.actions import Node
import os
from ament_index_python.packages import get_package_share_directory

def generate_launch_description():
    slam_config_file = os.path.join(
        get_package_share_directory('tekbot_control'),
        'config',
        'slam_toolbox.yaml'
    )

    return LaunchDescription([
        Node(
            package='slam_toolbox',
            executable='sync_slam_toolbox_node',
            name='slam_toolbox',
            output='screen',
            parameters=[slam_config_file]
        )
    ])
```

We saved this in a file called `slam_toolbox.launch.py`.

Then we ran it:

```bash
ros2 launch tekbot_control slam_toolbox.launch.py
```

---

## Step 4: Driving the Robot to Map

We used **keyboard teleoperation** to move the robot:

```bash
ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard
```

As the robot moved, SLAM Toolbox automatically updated the map.

---

## Step 5: Visualizing with RViz

Launching RViz via Launch File
To open RViz with the robot model and our custom visualization settings, we used the following command:

```bash
ros2 launch tekbot_description rviz.launch.py
```

This automatically:

* Loads the robot description

* Starts RViz with our tekbot_des.rviz config file

* Displays the live LIDAR data and the map being built in real-time

Make sure tekbot_description is built and sourced before running this:

```bash
cd ~/2025-Team-Epibot-Code/week3/IT_pole/tekbot_ws
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
```

Here‚Äôs what RViz showed us (automatically or manually added):

- The `/map` topic ‚Äî shows how the environment is being drawn

- The `/scan` topic ‚Äî shows what the LIDAR sees (laser beams hitting walls/obstacles)

- Fixed Frame set to map ‚Äî this makes all other data align properly in the map frame

If something wasn't showing, we just clicked `"Add"`, selected the appropriate display (like Map or LaserScan), and set the topic accordingly.

---

## Step 6: Saving the Map

Once we were happy with the map, we saved it with:

```bash
ros2 run nav2_map_server map_saver_cli -f ~/2025-Team-Epibot-Code/week3/IT_pole/tekbot_ws/src/map_provider/maps/tekbot_map
```

This created two files:

* `tekbot_map.yaml` (map configuration)
* `tekbot_map.pgm` (actual image)

---

## Some Problems We Faced (And Fixed)


### 1. **Two Maps Showing in RViz**

We shut down previous nodes and cleaned old topics to avoid overlapping maps.

### 2. **Map Server Failed to Load the Map**

The `map_server` failed to load the `.yaml` map file

## Summary

We successfully created a map using:

1. SLAM Toolbox
2. Our robot‚Äôs LIDAR and TF
3. Manual teleoperation

We learned how to set it up, visualize it, fix errors, and save the final result.
