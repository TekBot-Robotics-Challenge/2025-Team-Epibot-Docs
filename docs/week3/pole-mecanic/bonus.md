### ***Documentation of the Bonus Part*** Introduction 

`    `This part, designed by TEKBOT as part of the TRC Urban Resilience project, is an articulated support used in mechanical assemblies. It consists of a star-shaped base with holes for fastening, ensuring optimal stability. The upper section features a half-shell structure designed to hold a pin or a ball joint, allowing angular movements. Its geometry combines curved shapes and machined surfaces, ensuring both strength and precision.

Here is a step-by-step guide to making this piece : 

**Step One : Creating the Solid Base**

**Description** 

`    `This step shows the piece with its circular pass, a torso and a head in the shape of a balloon. To achieve this, follow these steps : 

`                                                            `How to achieve this ? 

**Actions** 

- Selection of the XY plane, particularly called Front Plane in SolidWorks.

***We will start by drawing line segments in order to give a precise shape to our solid.***                                                   Follow these steps: 

- Click on then in the window that opens choose the **line option** 

![](/images/mechanic_images/week3/bonus/image4.png)

- Position your cursor at the origin of your reference point then represent the 2D rectangle without taking into account the dimensions as follows :

- After that, click on then in the window that opens choose the Perimeter Circle option 

  ` `After that do this: ![](/images/mechanic_images/week3/bonus/image6.png)![](/images/mechanic_images/week3/bonus/image7.png)

` `Hold your pencil in this position and then draw a half-curve as in the following figure: 

![](/images/mechanic_images/week3/bonus/image9.png)

- After that we will assign the dimensions. To do this, click on Smart Dimension to automate the dimensions : 

![](/images/mechanic_images/week3/bonus/image10.png)

This function will allow you to automate the measurement of dimensions by modifying them yourself; you just need to click on the line you want to resize, hold the click in the desired direction.
