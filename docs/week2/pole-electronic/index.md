## 1. General Context

Black boxes are critical devices commonly used in fields such as aviation, automotive, and rail transport to record and monitor key operational data from equipment. By continuously collecting information like speed, position, and orientation, these systems help in understanding how machines behave and can provide useful insights in case of incidents or for performance improvement. The goal here is to develop a compact black box capable of capturing motion data, including speed and position, using a gyroscope and accelerometer sensor.

This second test of the Tekbot Robotics Challenge introduces the design and implementation of a simple embedded black box system. The goal here is to develop a compact black box capable of capturing motion data, including speed and posit+ion, using a gyroscope and accelerometer sensor. The collected data should be sent in real-time to a control station, where it can be displayed and analyzed. The project provides hands-on experience with embedded systems, data transmission, and hardware-software integration.

### Objectives of the test

### b. The MPU-6050: gyroscope and accelerometer in one sensor

The [MPU-6050](https://www.allelcoelec.com/blog/mpu-6050-in-action-practical-guide-to-setup%2Cconfiguration%2Cand-noise-management.html?srsltid=AfmBOooVL5CkBlAuw8WV0Yz7l7ZA2u8Ld6yBZFQf7kaTwiemNMmpUUey&utm_source=chatgpt.com#8.%20MPU-6050-Based%20Motion%20Trajectory%20Calculation) is a sensor module that combines a 3-axis gyroscope and a 3-axis accelerometer, enabling the detection of both rotational movement and linear acceleration in three dimensions. It features a Digital Motion Processor (DMP), which processes the raw sensor data using built-in algorithms to deliver reliable information on speed, rotation, and orientation. Communication with microcontrollers is accomplished via the I2C protocol, allowing for smooth integration into embedded systems. With its ability to provide real-time, accurate measurements while minimizing the processing load on the main system, the MPU-6050 is well suited for applications that require motion tracking and analysis.

### c. The LCD screen

The [Liquid-Crystal Display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display) (LCD) is a type of screen found in many electronic devices, like calculators, clocks, and TVs. It works by using a thin layer of liquid crystals placed between two filters. These crystals can change how light passes through them when  electricity is applied. The LCD itself does not create light. Instead, a light behind the screen (called a backlight) shines through the crystals. By controlling the crystals with electrical signals, the LCD can show different shapes, letters, or pictures in black and white or in color.

</p>

### d. The Zener Diode

The [Zener Diode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zener_diode) is a special type of semiconductor diode that is designed to allow current to flow in the reverse direction when the voltage across it reaches a specific value, called the Zener breakdown voltage. What this means is that a Zener diode can maintain a constant voltage in a circuit, even if the input voltage changes. When the voltage across the Zener diode exceeds its breakdown voltage, it starts conducting in reverse and keeps the voltage steady, making it very useful for voltage regulation and protecting sensitive electronic components from voltage spikes.

### e. The LM-7908: a voltage regulator

The [LM-7908](https://www.alldatasheet.com/datasheet-pdf/view/125278/NSC/LM1950.html) is a [voltage regulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage_regulator). Its purpose to keep the voltage at a constant level. It uses a negative feedback system to monitor and adjust the output, ensuring stable voltage even when the input voltage or load conditions change.

### f. The Cube (black box)

For this test, the black box will be represented by a **cube**. It will be mainly composed of the MPU-6050 sensor and the ATmega328P chip mounted on a Printed Circuit Board (PCB). The main functions of the cube will be the acquisition of movement data and the transmission of this data to the Control Station via an I2C bus.

### g. The Control Station

The Control Station's main tasks are the processing and displaying of the data it receives from **the cube**. It will be composed of another ATmega328P chip mounted on a dedicated PCB and the LCD screen.

### h. Our custom power supply

To power up our setup, we should build a power supply that is independent from the cube and that will provide safe and sufficient voltage to all the components. For that, we will use:

- 4 lithium batteries to supply 14.8V
- a zener diode to stabilize the voltage at 5V for the control station
- a LM-7809 to bring the voltage to 9V for the black box

## 3. Computer-Aided Design

### c. The Cube design

For the cube design, we used Autodesk Fusion 360 (_download [here](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/download)_) to design and model the components for this project. Fusion 360 is a comprehensive, cloud-based platform that integrates design, engineering, and manufacturing into a single tool. It offers powerful features for parametric modeling, assembly creation, simulation, and detailed rendering, making it ideal for both prototyping and final product development.

Our cube has a side height of _7 centimeters_ with one face open to visualize the internal circuitry.

## 4. Microcontroller Logic on the I2C bus

### a. What is I2C ?

The [Inter-Integrated Circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C) (I2C), is a communication protocol that allows multiple electronic components, like sensors and microcontrollers, to talk to each other using just two wires: one for data (SDA) and one for the clock signal (SCL). With I2C, a single device acts as the controller (or master) that manages the communication, while other devices act as followers (or slaves). Each device on the I2C bus has a unique address, so the controller can talk to each one individually, even though they share the same wires. This makes I2C a simple and efficient way to connect many devices together in a circuit, saving wiring and making communication between parts much easier.

### b. Microcontroller configuration

The microcontroller configuration is one of the core aspects of this test. It ensures seamless communication between components, accurate data collection from sensors, and reliable transmission of information to the control station, forming the foundation of the systemâ€™s functionality.

In this project, two microcontrollers ATmega328P are used.

- The **Cube microcontroller** is configured as the I2C master. It is responsible for collecting motion data from the MPU-6050 sensor (which acts as an I2C slave), processing this data, and sending it to the control station.
- The **Control station microcontroller** is also configured as an I2C slave, listening for incoming data from the cube.

The LCD screen is directly connected to the **Control station microcontroller**, and is therefore an I2c slave. If additional sensors or peripherals were to be added (perhaps more sensors), they could also be configured as I2C slaves.

This master-slave structure is necessary because it guarantees that only one device (the master) controls the communication, avoiding conflicts and ensuring that messages are sent and received in an orderly and predictable way. In summary, the master-slave relationship organizes the roles and responsibilities of each device, making the system both scalable and reliable.

### c. Sensor Data Acquisition and Processing through the I2C bus

Accurate acquisition and processing of sensor data are essential for monitoring the motion and orientation of the cube. The sensor used in this project is a combined gyroscope and accelerometer: the MPU6050, which communicates with the cubeâ€™s microcontroller via the I2C bus.

#### Acquisition Steps:

- The microcontroller initializes the sensor by setting up communication parameters and, if necessary, calibrating the sensor to minimize measurement errors.
- At regular intervals, the microcontroller requests raw data from the sensor, including acceleration on each axis (X, Y, Z) and angular velocity (rotation rates) on each axis.
- The I2C protocol ensures that the sensor can reliably respond to requests from the master microcontroller without data collisions.

#### Processing Steps:

- The raw sensor readings are converted into meaningful physical units (e.g., acceleration in gâ€™s or m/sÂ², angular velocity in Â°/s).
- Processing algorithms, such as filtering (e.g., moving average or complementary filter), are applied to reduce noise (_small, unwanted variations or disturbances in the sensor data that do not represent the actual movement of the cube_) and improve data stability.
- The processed sensor data is then formatted for transmission to the control station over the I2C bus and for display on the LCD.

This systematic approach to data acquisition and processing enables the system to provide real-time, accurate feedback on the cubeâ€™s speed and position, which is crucial for the core functionality of the project.

## 5. Programming the circuits

After the wiring is done, we need to program both the ATmega328P chips from the Cube and The control station.

Download the Arduino IDE using this [link](https://www.arduino.cc/). It's a software that will allow you to run and upload your code to the MCUs. Once the installation is done, we can set up by installing the necessary libraries via the **Library Manager** in the Arduino IDE (_make sure that you also install their dependencies when prompted to_). We will need the following Arduino libraries:

- The **Wire** library for I2C communication

  ```
  #include <Wire.h>
  ```
- The **LiquidCrystal** library for managing our LCD screen

  ```
  #include <LiquidCrystal.h>
  ```
- The **MPU6050** library for managing the sensor

  ```
  #include <MPU6050.h>
  ```

### Fetching data from the MPU-6050 sensor in The Cube

In the **setup()** function, we call `Serial.begin(9600);` to start the _serial monitor_ at 9600 [bauds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baud), and `Wire.begin();` to start the I2C bus as master.

We first need to initialize the MPU-6050 sensor. For that, in the **setup()** function, we call `mpu.initialize();`. 

In the **loop()** function, we do this for reading raw data from our MPU-6050 sensor:

```
int16_t ax, ay, az;
mpu.getAcceleration(&ax, &ay, &az);
```

We then need to send this fetched data to the slave (microcontroller in the Control Station) through the I2C bus:

```
  Wire.beginTransmission(slave_address); // start i2c data transfer
  // ====== Write the data to the i2c bus ======
  Wire.write((byte)(aX >> 8));
  Wire.write((byte)aX);
  Wire.write((byte)(aY >> 8));
  Wire.write((byte)aY);
  Wire.write((byte)(aZ >> 8));
  Wire.write((byte)aZ);
  Wire.endTransmission(); // stop data transfer

```

_Download the full code for the black box [here](https://github.com/kkbroxane/2025-Team-Epibot-Docs/raw/main/docs/week2/pole-electronic/code/the_cube_box.ino)_.

### Outputting from Control Station

We first need to declare our declare our LCD display.

```
// The LCD declaration with connected pin numbers as parameters
LiquidCrystal lcd(18, 16, 23, 24, 25, 3);
```

We then initialize the LCD module in the **setup()** function by doing:
`lcd.begin(16, 2);         // Initialize LCD`. 


`Wire.onReceive(receiveEvent);` enables us to read data as it becomes available on the i2c bus using a custom function **receiveEvent**:

```
  index = 0; // Global variable to track number of bytes read (volatile uint8_t index = 0)

  // start reading and storing data as soon as it is sent
  while (Wire.available() && index < 6)
  {
    buffer[index++] = Wire.read(); // read bytes from the i2c bus
  }
  //  
  if (index == 6) {
    ax = (buffer[0] << 8) | buffer[1];
    ay = (buffer[2] << 8) | buffer[3];
    az = (buffer[4] << 8) | buffer[5];
  }
```

To print the readings from our sensor to the screen, we use `lcd.clear();` to first clear the screen buffer, then `lcd.setCursor()` to adjust the cursor's position on the screen, and finally `lcd.print();` to write to the screen.
