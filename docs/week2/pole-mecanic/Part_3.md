## <span style="color: #9AC8EB;">Tools used and role</span>

The goal of this task is to create a pocket (hollow) on the part of part II. To achieve this task, you will need to use a number of tools, namely:
 -"Extruded Cut" allows for removing material from a 3D solid to achieve a certain result.
  -The "Shell" tool is used to hollow out a solid part to make it hollow with walls of constant thickness. It allows material to be removed from the inside of a solid while maintaining its external shape.
  -"Convert entities" is used to project or copy edges, faces, or sketch contours onto the current sketch plane. It saves time by allowing you to reuse existing geometry instead of redrawing it.

To make this hollow you have to follow a certain number of very precise steps, namely:
-Click on the shell (the role of the shell is specified at the beginning of the file) in order to make a hollow on the surface
-Fill in the information as shown in the second photo of this step
-Confirm the creation of the hollow by clicking on the green check mark

## <span style="color: #08C5D1;">How to remove the cylindrical part on the face?</span>

The purpose of this step is to remove the cylindrical part located on the face in order to carry out the requested task. The part to be removed is indicated in the image below

![Image](/images/mechanic_images/week2/part_3/image5.png)

The first thing to do to accomplish this task will be to click on the face and then convert this face into an entity using "Convert Entities" which is used to project or copy existing contours of a part or a sketch onto a new plane.
