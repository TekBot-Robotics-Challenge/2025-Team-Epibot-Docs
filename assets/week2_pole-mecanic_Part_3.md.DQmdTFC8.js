To achieve this task, you will need to use a number of tools, namely: -&quot;Extruded Cut&quot; allows for removing material from a 3D solid to achieve a certain result. -The &quot;Shell&quot; tool is used to hollow out a solid part to make it hollow with walls of constant thickness. It allows material to be removed from the inside of a solid while maintaining its external shape. -&quot;Convert entities&quot; is used to project or copy edges, faces, or sketch contours onto the current sketch plane. It saves time by allowing you to reuse existing geometry instead of redrawing it.</p><h2 id="how-to-start-creation-of-the-part" tabindex="-1"><span style="color:#08C5D1;"><strong>How to start creation of the part?</strong></span> <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-to-start-creation-of-the-part" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #08C5D1;&quot;&gt;**How to start creation of the part?**&lt;/span&gt;&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="short-demo" tabindex="-1"><span style="color:#9AC8EB;"><strong>Short Demo</strong></span> <a class="header-anchor" href="#short-demo" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #9AC8EB;&quot;&gt;**Short Demo**&lt;/span&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3>',7),s("iframe",{src:"https://player.vimeo.com/video/1094425289?h=90981825ad&badge=0&autopause=0&player_id=0&app_id=58479",frameborder:"0",allow:"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share",style:{top:"0",left:"0",width:"100%",height:"300px"},title:"demo-part3_gRd72YLi"},null,-1),t('<h2 id="implementation-steps" tabindex="-1"><span style="color:#08C5D1;"><strong>Implementation Steps</strong></span> <a class="header-anchor" href="#implementation-steps" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #08C5D1;&quot;&gt;**Implementation Steps**&lt;/span&gt;&quot;">​</a></h2><p>To complete this task, the first thing to do is to download the part provided after completing part II.
