To achieve this, we first brainstormed and sketched out ideas for what the conveyor would look like. The conveyor had to be 650mm long and 100mm above the ground. It also had to be modeled in SolidWorks. The process took two directions: the ideation phase, marked by virtual design, and the physical construction phase. This documentation details the process we followed during these phases, the mechanical constraints we encountered, and how we overcame them.</p><h2 id="virtual-design-phase" tabindex="-1"><span style="color:#3498DB;">Virtual Design Phase</span> <a class="header-anchor" href="#virtual-design-phase" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3498DB;&quot;&gt;Virtual Design Phase&lt;/span&gt;&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="overview-of-the-virtual-design-process" tabindex="-1"><span style="color:#1ABC9C;">Overview of the Virtual Design Process</span> <a class="header-anchor" href="#overview-of-the-virtual-design-process" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #1ABC9C;&quot;&gt;Overview of the Virtual Design Process&lt;/span&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The virtual design focused on SolidWorks for 3D modeling and Illustrator for sketches intended for laser cutting. The conveyor had to be 650mm long, with the belt positioned 100mm above the ground. First, we had to think about how our conveyor would stand. We opted for two parallel vertical supports connected by horizontal planks to ensure balance. A final horizontal plate was added to keep the entire structure fixed and sturdy.</p>',5),e("iframe",{src:"https://player.vimeo.com/video/1104886435?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0&badge=0&autopause=0&player_id=0&app_id=58479",width:"100%",height:"300px",frameborder:"0",allow:"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share",referrerpolicy:"strict-origin-when-cross-origin",title:"vue_3d_convoyeur_soilid_work",muted:""},null,-1),e("h3",{id:"support",tabindex:"-1"},[e("span",{style:{color:"#1ed3afff"}}," Support "),t(),e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#support","aria-label":'Permalink to "<span style="color: #1ed3afff;"> Support </span>"'},"​")],-1),e("iframe",{src:"https://player.vimeo.com/video/1104886485?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0&badge=0&autopause=0&player_id=0&app_id=58479",frameborder:"0",allow:"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share",referrerpolicy:"strict-origin-when-cross-origin",style:{top:"0",left:"0",width:"100%",height:"300px"},title:"vue_3d_support_convoyeur",muted:""},null,-1),o('<h3 id="key-components-and-design-process" tabindex="-1"><code>Key Components and Design Process</code>: <a class="header-anchor" href="#key-components-and-design-process" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;`Key Components and Design Process`:&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><h4 id="vertical-support" tabindex="-1"><span style="color:#DB6A8F;">Vertical Support</span> <a class="header-anchor" href="#vertical-support" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #DB6A8F&quot;&gt;Vertical Support&lt;/span&gt;&quot;">​</a></h4></li></ul>',2),e("iframe",{src:"https://player.vimeo.com/video/1104886493?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0&badge=0&autopause=0&player_id=0&app_id=58479",width:"100%",height:"300px",frameborder:"0",allow:"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share",referrerpolicy:"strict-origin-when-cross-origin",title:"vue_3d_support_verticale",muted:""},null,-1),e("p",null,"This is the vertical face that supports the entire assembly.
