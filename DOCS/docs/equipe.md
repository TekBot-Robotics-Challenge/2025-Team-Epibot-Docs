## IT Pole

### Mission

The main mission of the IT sub-team is to develop intelligent and modular software solutions that enable autonomous behavior, real-time decision-making, and seamless communication between hardware components and user interfaces. These systems must evolve across the selection tests and culminate in an integrated solution for the final conveyor belt triage challenge.

  Expertise
</h2>  

The IT sub-team must demonstrate expertise in the following areas:

<p style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">
  Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
</p>

  - Designing flexible, reusable, and extensible class structures in C++ or Python.<br>
  - Using encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism effectively.

<p style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">
  ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2)
</p>

  - Building modular robotic systems using nodes, topics, services, and actions.<br>
  - Implementing publishers and subscribers for sensor data evaluation.<br>
  - Writing launch files for system-level execution.

<p style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">
  Pathfinding Algorithms
</p>

  - Developing and integrating navigation algorithms such as A*, Dijkstra, RRT, etc.<br>
  - Simulating robot movement in Gazebo and visualizing paths in RViz2.<br>
  - Managing obstacle avoidance and dynamic path planning.

<p style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">
  Embedded Systems Integration
</p>

  - Communicating with microcontrollers.<br>
  - Processing sensor inputs and triggering actuators through logic decisions.

<p style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">
  Web Interface Development
</p>

  - Creating intuitive dashboards to display real-time data.<br>
  - Integrating backend logic with frontend visualization.

<p style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">
  System Documentation
</p>

  - Maintaining GitHub repositories with clear commit history.<br>
  - Providing UML diagrams, technical explanations, and simulation results.

  Challenge Goals
</h2>

### Test 1: Robot Class Management
  
#### Objective:

Create a base Robot class with two derived subclasses, each redefining a virtual move() method.

#### Deliverables:

- OOP structure with encapsulation (getters/setters)
- Inheritance and polymorphism demonstrated
- UML diagram showing class relationships
- Clean, well-documented code in C++ or Python

---

### Test 2: Introduction to ROS2
  
#### Objective:

Build a ROS2 package with a node that generates random sensor data and another that validates it.

#### Deliverables:

- ROS2 package named sensor_data_evaluation
- Publisher node sending data (temperature, humidity, pressure) every 0.5s
- Subscriber node validating data within expected ranges
- Launch file to start both nodes simultaneously
- Proper documentation and logging

### Test 3: Pathfinding Algorithm
  
#### Objective:

Implement a pathfinding algorithm (A*, Dijkstra, etc.) in a simulated environment using ROS2, Gazebo, and RViz2.

#### Deliverables:

- Autonomous path generation from point A to B
- Obstacle detection and avoidance
- Visualization in Gazebo and RViz2
- Well-documented implementation and performance analysis
